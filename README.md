Dotbox is a web browser game fully built with Python 3 and Flask. This is a computerised version of an old classic pencil–and–paper game called dots and boxes. The app enables a gamer to contend with both other human players or CPUs. Users can select from among 5 kinds of boards which differ in dimensions.
